        <p>The Windblume Cactuar is a distant cousin of the Cactuar monster from the Final fanasty games. These seeming harmless cactuar have harnessed the power of when and is very hard to attack, leaving magic and ranged attacks to be your only options. It attacks with a number of wind spells, using magic to send it's needles flying towards you. Since the rare nauture of the Windblume Cactuar, they offer tons of EXP and GOLD on defeating one, you may even find rare armor or weapons. So keep an eye out for out flying firends.</p>
